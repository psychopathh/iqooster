				"I am a teacher and often my work stresses my brain heavily. I deal with a lot of children and because there aren’t enough teachers in my school, we work more than we normally should. I began to notice that due to the stress, I was getting tired mentally and I couldn’t do more than I wanted and I lost interest in doing things. However, my neurologist advised me to drink IQooster and once I began to take it, within a week I felt rejuvenated and eager to work even more than before. I also noticed I was barely tired when working. It’s always nice to have the brain working in full force. Being in this state opens up many opportunities and possibilities that were unreachable before. IQooster is simply an excellent product!",
				"I needed to improve my brain functioning so I got IQooster. I was overwhelmed with work, I couldn’t redo everything immediately, and because of that, I began to make mistakes frequently that soon reflected on my salary. I sought to “grow wiser“. I was watching TV when I first learned about IQooster, so I became caught on. IQooster has really helped me. After 2 weeks of taking it, I began to notice changes. I started to think straight and quickly again and my analytical thinking and memory improved tremendously. I was beginning to contribute new ideas at meetings. As a result, my salary was raised by 30% and I think, this is just the beginning.  IQooster is a wonderful solution for brain improvement that I recommend to everyone!",
				"We are often stressed because of work, in addition, it is important that decisions made are right and quick based on analysis of data available and capabilities. All of this requires stretching the brain beyond its normal capabilities. Due to this, I have been taking vitamins for my brain for the last 10 years or more. I switched to IQooster about 2 years ago. It gave an impressive effect, so I have preferred it over others since it is more balanced. If you haven’t tried IQooster, you should. It is arguably the best solution for boosting brain capacity that I know of.",
				"I have been taking IQooster before any exam session for the last two years. There have been significant improvements since, but most remarkably, my speed of assimilation of the most complex information has increased. I can learn anything necessary to pass my exams within a week! After taking IQooster, the brain begins to run like a clock – No messed up mind or sleep deficiency. Everything is clear and pure. Even after studying textbooks for the whole day, I don’t get tired. I recommended IQooster to a lot of my friends and now they are actively taking it. It’s a great solution for students, and I believe I will keep taking it, even after university. I want to reach my best in life and get to the top of my career. I’m sure IQooster will help me get there."
